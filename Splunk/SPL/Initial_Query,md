###Cleanup: The SPL (Search Processing Language) below manipulates the raw, .csv data into meaningful fields with fieldnames more easily understood by the audience.  
###Timestamps: The SPL creates additional fields to categorize timestamps and determine whether the age of the timestamps warrants remediation.
###Regex: Fields containing hectic values are maniuplated in the 'rex' command and uneccesary characters are removed

| inputlookup Denton_AD_users.csv
```^^^semi-cleaned raw user data saved in the Splunk UI as a .csv file```

```Evaluation of PasswordLastSet to Current Date - ncessary to see the age of the password```
| eval epochDate1=strptime(PasswordLastSet, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
| eval cDate=now()
| eval cFormat=strftime(cDate,"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
| eval PwdLastSet_DaysDiff = round((cDate - epochDate1)/86400)

```Evaluation of LastLogonDate to Current Date - necessary to see how long it has been since the user last logged in```
| eval epochDate2=strptime(LastLogonDate, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
| eval cDate=now()
| eval cFormat=strftime(cDate,"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
| eval LastLogon_DaysDiff = round((cDate - epochDate2)/86400)

```Regex to clean timestamp values - necessary to change the format of the time, this helps makes the timestamp look 'prettier'```
| rex field=LastLogonDate "(?<LastLogonDate>\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4}) \d{1,2}:\d{2}"
| rex field=PasswordLastSet "(?<PasswordLastSet>\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4}) \d{1,2}:\d{2}"

```Regex to clean MemberOf (Groups) - necessary in cleaning up the Microsoft verbiage and group dN (distinguishedName) so all that remains is the name of the group tied to the user's account```
| rex field=MemberOf max_match=0 "RP=(?<MemberOf>[^,$]*[,]*[^,$]*")
| rex field=MemberOf mode=sed "s/,(RP|ZW)=[^,$]*//g"

```Regex to clean the user's Manager - necessary because the 'Manager' value is published as the Manager's identity displaying as a dN (distinguishedName), this clarifies who the user's manager is more legibly```
| rex field=Manager max_match=0 "RP=(?<Manager>[^,$]*[,]*[^,$]*")
| rex field=Manager mode=sed "s/\\\\//g"

```Regex to clean the user's DN (DistinguishedName) - necessary in understanding where in Denton's Active Directory instance accounts are located, also helps define a user's operating purpose, use-case```
| rex field=CanonicalName "\/(?<CanonicalName>[^\/]+)\/"

```Eval for Expired Password - simple eval to categorize whether a pwd is expired in a yes/no category```
| eval pwdStatus = if(PwdLastSet_DaysDiff > 90, "Expired", "Valid")

```Eval for Dormant Users - if the user has not logged on since 30 days from the current date the account is considered Dormant or 'not in use'```
| eval logonStatus = if(LastLogon_DaysDiff > 90, "Dormant", "Valid")
